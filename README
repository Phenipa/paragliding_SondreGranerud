This is ready to be deployed on heroku, where it will implement all routes specified in assignment 2 of cloud technologies.
The webhook-clock is deployed on a seperate openstack-vm using its own repo. It can be found on: https://github.com/Phenipa/paragliding_SondreGranerud_trigger
The clock is intended to be ran once, and be triggered by crontab, as this is what I found to be the most stable
