Usage:
  When pushed to heroku, this is an api which when recieving POST requests with valid igc-file urls will parse it and put into objects.
  All tracks are saved in memory, and as such are volatile. In heroku, all tracks are deleted after about 30 mins as heroku puts the app to sleep, which deletes all in-memory info
  The root of the url is under /igcinfo/api/. Only sub-paths of this is handled, all others lead to 404.
  GET /igcinfo/api/ returns some metadata about the api.
  GET /igcinfo/api/igc/ returns the ids of all tracks currently in memory.
  POST /igcinfo/api/igc/ parses the url in body and adds it to an in-memory database. The response is the id which was assigned to that track if accepted, or appropriate error if not.
  POST request must be in JSON-format and contain body with {"url":value].
  GET /igcinfo/api/igc/<id> returns H_date, pilot, glider, glider_id and track_length of the track whose id was provided. If id is invalid, 404.
  GET /igcinfo/api/igc/<id>/<field> returns the specified field of the specified tracks id.
